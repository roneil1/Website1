                            Donald John Duck is an American Duck and the President-Duckelect of the United States. In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president as a Republican and quickly emerged as the front-runner for his party's nomination. His geese suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the pond convention. Trump won the swamp election on November 8, 2016, by earning more Electoral College votes than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who won the popular vote. As of November 2016, Trump's presidential transition is underway and he is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2017. At 70 years old, he will be the oldest first-term Duck.
